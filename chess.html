 <h3><! OwO>What's this?</h3>
 <p>I recently started playing chess, so I'll just drop there those "principles" I learn the more games I play. <br>Most of them come from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AGADMATOR/featured" target="_blank">agadmator's chess channel</a>, go check him out! :D</p>
 <p>Principles:
 <ul>
  <li>You do not move the same piece twice</li>
  <li>You do NOT move the same piece twice</li>
  <li>Control the center</li>
  <li>Capture towards the center</li>
  <li>Lose the Queen, lose the game</li>
  <li>Castle ASAP (king side is faster, queen side is more aggressive)</li>
  <li>Always play King b1</li>
  <li>Never play f3!</li>
  <li>Improve the position of your pieces</li>
  <li>Remove the defenders</li>
  <li>If you(or your opponent) only have one bishop, put your pawns on its opposite color.</li>
  <li>Connect the rooks!</li>
  <li>Put rooks on (semi)open files</li>
  <li>Put rooks behind passed pawns</li>
  <li>Passed pawns must be pushed</li>
  <li>Develop the  Queen last</li>
  <li>Develop the pieces deep into the board</li>
  <li>Releasing the tension in the center is a sign of weakness</li>
  <li>If your opponent attacks queen side, you should attack king side and viceversa</li>
  <li>If your opponent attacks in the center, you should attack in the sides of the board, and viceversa</li>
  <li>You don't want knights to guard each other</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
 <p>Openings I play as white:
 <ul>
  <li>Patzer's Opening</li>
  <li>English System</li>
  <li>Reti</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
  <p>Openings I play as black:
 <ul>
  <li>Icelandic Gambit</li>
  <li>Benoni Defense</li>
 </ul>
